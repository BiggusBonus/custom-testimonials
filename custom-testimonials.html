        “My first book was published by a publishing company and all I had to do was submit my manuscript and they did everything else to bring it to print. I decided to self-publish my next book and never realized the choices I had to make and the expenses I would have to incur. One of my best choices was to engage the services of Michael Pietrobon of Foglio Publishing. He did an outstanding job of compiling my book and transforming my text into a beautiful work of art. He worked with me every step of the way with professional advice and patience. I am very grateful for his services and highly recommend them to anyone who is considering self-publishing and printing their book.”

        “Michael at Foglio helped me realize my dream of presenting my daughter with a book version of her PhD thesis on graduation day.  
        He was a delight to work with, took a personal interest, designed a unique, artful and perfectly suited cover and promised and delivered the result by the necessary date. All at a very competitive price. A gorgeous softcover, which presented her work beautifully included dynamic great chapter headings and organization plus terrific photos and artwork. She is thrilled with it! I’m a retired librarian after almost 50 years on the job so know a bit about books. Thank you Michael!”

        “I’ve been working with Foglio for my custom design and printing needs, and I couldn’t be more satisfied. After dealing with a large company that often felt impersonal, moving to Foglio was a breath of fresh air. Michael and his team have consistently delivered exceptional service and high-quality products that surpass my expectations every time.
        The attention to detail and dedication to customer satisfaction at Foglio is truly remarkable. Whether I need a simple design tweak or a complex print job, they handle it all with professionalism and expertise. Michael’s personalized approach ensures that every project is tailored to my specific needs, and the results are always stunning.
        One of the standout qualities of Foglio is their commitment to quality. The prints are crisp, vibrant, and durable, reflecting the superior materials and techniques they use. It’s clear that they take great pride in their work, and it shows in the final product.
        If you’re looking for a reliable, high-quality custom design and printing service, I highly recommend Foglio. Michael and his team go above and beyond to deliver exceptional results.”

        “Michael P, Foglio, Founder and Production Manager is helping me produce two books for notable clients.  
        He knows his stuff and their passion for design and beautiful books is resonant and profound.  
        Both clear and empathetic; helping find the best production options at a great price.  
        Bonus, is supporting local business in the greater GTA.  
        Note that Foglio has more custom options than other more cookie cutter book maker options - like custom endpaper, and foil cover printing.  
        5 stars, I highly recommend working with Michael and his team.

        “I had a manuscript and ideas. Michael took my words and images and turned them into a book. I now have my book in my hands and I like it. It looks and feels good - the way I wanted it, not according to someone else’s ideas.  
        Getting it done required twists, turns and changes. Through it all Michael responded promptly and clearly - listening. With patient attention he brought the images I had in mind gradually into form.  
        For anyone who is looking for someone who can create with you - not just for you but with you, I recommend Michael Pietrobon at Foglio Custom Book Specialists.”

        “Michael and his Foglio process helped me to see my work from a designer’s point of view. My past self-publishing experiences were efficient, but working with Michael took the appearance of my finished book to the level of art. Because I am Canadian, and because <em>The Buttes</em> is set in a Canadian landscape, I was happy to find Foglio Custom Book Specialists, a Canadian company, to birth this Essex County farm family into the vast universe of stories and the readers who love them.”

        “Michael at Foglio designed the cover of my novel, ‘The Denied Stone.’ It was a pleasure working with him on it, and if I do write another book, I will absolutely work with him again.  
        Michael is a good listener, a close reader, attentive to detail, and -- most importantly -- highly insightful. I had a clear vision for the cover, and he delivered on it quite well. But he also included a different version entirely based on a passage in the book, and it was so compelling and well-executed that I went with his idea.  
        Michael typeset the book’s interior and undertook multiple revisions -- turning each around in one or two days. He also created eBook files for me. He made sure the various revisions conformed to online bookseller guidelines.  
        As a first-time author, he was also incredibly patient with my last-minute revisions to the text. (Again, sorry about that, Michael!)  
        Overall, I could not be more pleased with how this project turned out. Michael is creative, attentive, diligent, and patient. I absolutely made the right choice in collaborating with him, and, if you choose to do so, rest assured you will have made the right choice as well.”
